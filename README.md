Design a food menu app for a Japanese restaurant
With just a few taps on their phone, users will be able to order delicious food.
I conducted interviews, which will result in the creation of empathy maps and the identification of the problem, in order to design hypotheses to meet the needs of the users.
The majority of the users interviewed came from online reviews of the apps. It includes a primary research group of people of various ages.
The issue we discovered is that the user-friendliness of these apps is not consistent.
When creating the Villages Sushi food menu app, I discovered how important it is to pay close attention to user comments and suggestions in order to make the app better. I have design the app with visually comfortable for users to see and use for long time.
